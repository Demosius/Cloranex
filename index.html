    <p>Approximately three millennia ago - no two calenders can agree on an exact date - the world was struck by a great
        magical cataclysm. Up until that point the magical energies of the world were fickle, requiring great skill and
        patience to harness. But ever since the mystical energies have suffused and saturated everything.</p>
    <p>The effects of this offer-saturation of magic has been numerous and great. The most significant, at least to the
        typical outside observer, is likely the rapid evolution of man and the now numerous descendant races. Everything
        intelligent that walks on two legs and is native to the world is indeed descendant of humans. </p>

    <p>In the initial destruction of the cataclysm only a small portion of a single city survived, while All other
        structures became ash or ruin. This surviving city would become Argwaith, and the citizens the ancestors of the
        elves. It is the elves alone that have a recorded history from the start of the cataclysm, and their calenders
        reckon it to be the 2872nd year since then. It is also claimed that they have some texts remainig from even
        before the destruction, though if this is true they guard it jealously, for none outside their kin have seen
        evidence of such ancient texts.</p>
