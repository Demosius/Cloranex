    <p>Approximately three millennia ago - no two calenders can agree on an exact date - the world was struck by a great
        magical cataclysm. Up until that point the magical energies of the world were fickle, requiring great skill and
        patience to harness. But ever since the mystical energies have suffused and saturated everything.</p>
    <p>The effects of this offer-saturation of magic has been numerous and great. The most significant, at least to the
        typical outside observer, is likely the rapid evolution of man and the now numerous descendant races. Everything
        intelligent that walks on two legs and is native to the world is indeed descendant of humans. </p>

    <p>In the initial destruction of the cataclysm only a small portion of a single city survived, while All other
        structures became ash or ruin. This surviving city would become Argwaith, and the citizens the ancestors of the
        elves. It is the elves alone that have a recorded history from the start of the cataclysm, and their calenders
        reckon it to be the 2872nd year since the destruction. It is also claimed that they have some texts remaining
        from even
        before the destruction, though if this is true they guard it jealously, for none outside their kin have seen
        evidence of such ancient texts.</p>
    <p>Immediately following the cataclysm the global human population was much reduced. But such was the magic swirling
        throughout the realms - through air, water, and earth - that magic would frequently suffuse individuals granting
        them extraordinary powers. As people would find themselves in groups, soon the magics would cause rapidly
        accelerated evolution causing new races to develop over a short time. Some indiviuals, for reasons none could
        gleam, would be extremely open to the magics and would grow excessively powerful and come to be known as gods.
        More often than not these gods would lead tribes of people, and their followers would tend to evolve and mutate
        toward the image of their gods. </p>
    <p>For a long time these gods wandered the lands and waged wars against each other. The destruction wrought as a
        result of these battles was immense and near constant. As such very few peoples managed to build beyond basic
        wooden structures. The primary exceptions to this was the elves - who were well organised from the begining and
        extremely protective of their city, old and new; the dwarves - who managed to hide away within the mountains
        were few would bother to follow; and the strange lizard people who dwelt in an overgrown jungle valley and
        followed a mysterious god with the power of future sight which helped to keep them protected.</p>
    <p>The people who formed tribes without gods, whether the gods were slain, or they simply chose not to follow any,
        were known as the godless, and would constantly roam the land. After the gods were near all slain their other
        name became used with more frequency: nomads, or the nomadei, and would eventually simply be known as the noma.
        They changed far less physically than most all of the other peoples, but as a result also seemed to store a
        small amount evolutionary energies which apparently allows them to adapt far better than any other race, and in
        modern times can even be seen to physically change when they spend substantial amounts of time with people
        foreign to them, where other races - since the magical torrents covering the earth have died down over time -
        now have a more or less set physiology that no longer changes significantly between generations.</p>
    <p>Due to the immense magical presence of the world, the realm became more visible to worlds on other planes.
        Eventually this would lead the celestials to Cloranex, and they did not like what they found. They were offended
        by the chaos, and even more by the presence of such powerful beings as these gods. None, they figured, deserved
        such reverence as did their own gods. True gods by their account, that these magical mutants could not be
        allowed to imitate. And so they began a crusade to rid the world of its gods. First they gathered many the
        tribes of the godless noma. They called to all that would come, but those that did were almost entirely of the
        noma. After they gathered armies of their own kin and men, they formed alliances with both the dwarves and
        elves, who each saw value in ending the roiling chaos outside their walls. And so went the crusade which would
        last centuries, and was extremely successful as they slew near every god. What would be the final campaign was
        against the four dark gods of the north. Knowing what was coming, these powerful gods had allied themselves and
        prepared their people well. It was a dark and bloody affair in which neither side would be able to claim true
        victory. However, after three of north gods were apparently slain, the final god absorbed their essence becoming
        a great abomination with three faces and personalities bound by the will of the internal fourth. With the power
        gained by this act he was able to force back the alliance of men and angels, who at this point had taken heavy
        losses themselves. Far too week to continue the campaign in earnest, the crusaders contented themselves to sit
        back and regain their strength, but made sure to put up a great barrier to keep the recovering northern forces
        back. To the modern day this barrier is still guarded by races of kinds, but the elves, dwarves, and noma under
        the celestials feel particularly duty bound to do so, and as such make up the majority of the north barrier
        garrisons.</p>
    <p>After this failure in the north, there was still the matter of two gods. Those of the elves and the dwarves. It
        would seem that the dwarves had reasonably assumed that their alliance and participation in the crusade had
        exempted their own god from execution. They were mistaken. The elves however were not so naive, and hid their
        god before the inevitable attack from the powerful winged celestials. It is often suggested that the celestials
        had originally intended to spare the elf and dwarf gods, but couldn't stomach their presence after their
        embarrassing defeat in the north. Whether it was embarasment, frustration, or if they had decieved from the
        begining and had always intended this end, it makes no difference. After the dwarven god was slain and the elven
        god hidden away, the once mighty alliance was now fractured beyond repair. Even the dwarves now distrusted the
        elves as they had not apparently seen fit to warn them about the impending attacks. The only thing that stopped
        immediate all out warfare between the three mighty nations was the still looming threat from the north.</p>
