    <p>Approximately three millenea ago - no two calenders can agree on an exact date - the world was struck by a great magical cataclysm. Up until that point the magical energies of the world were fickle, requiring great skill and patience to harness. But ever since the mystical energies have suffused and saturated everything.

    The effects of this offer-saturation of magic has been numerous and great. The most significant, at least to the typical outside observer, is likely the rapid evolution of man and the now numerous descendant races. Everything intelligent that walks on two legs and is native to the world is indeed descendant of humans. <p>
